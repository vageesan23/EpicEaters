                Building a food delivery service with a website and mobile app is a smart strategy to appeal to a large market of interested consumers. For restaurants, it is an additional revenue stream that they would not have otherwise been able to touch.
                <br /><br />
                With individual consumers, it is a way of sourcing food quickly and easily from their favorite places. People need to eat, and having a means of providing them with the food they are interested in immediately and efficiently is a great strategy.
